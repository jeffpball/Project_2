## Project Description
The Seattle metropolitan area is thriving and it's showing no signs of slowing down in the near future. Although local government is doing everything it can to alleviate traffic, the mood around town would suggest that it's not quite enough. Our app, ComfyRide, is a modest yet tangible part of the solution. We seek to reduce traffic and our city's carbon footprint.

Our team built a ride share application with functionalities that enable users to register as a driver and schedule rides, or find rides as a passenger. 
 
## Mission Statement
To create a digital platform where people can post carpool routes and join rides in a user friendly way. The impression and feel of the app is simple, current, and user-friendly.
